### 1. **Code Structure** 

The script is structured as a single class `MobiusStrip` that encapsulates all logic related to creating, analyzing, and visualizing a Möbius strip. This object-oriented approach makes the code modular, reusable, and easy to understand.

Key components include: 

* **`__init__()`**: Initializes parameters (radius `R`, width `w`, resolution `n`) and computes a mesh grid using the Möbius strip's parametric equations.
* **`_compute_coordinates()`**: Uses the parametric equations to calculate 3D coordinates `(x, y, z)` for the surface.
* **`surface_area()`**: Numerically approximates the surface area using gradients and cross products.
* **`edge_length()`**: Approximates the total length of the Möbius strip's boundary edges.
* **`plot()`**: Generates a 3D plot of the strip using `matplotlib`.

A `main` block creates a MöbiusStrip object, prints the calculated geometric properties, and displays a 3D plot.



### 2. **Surface Area Approximation**

To compute the surface area numerically:

* First, we calculate partial derivatives of the position vectors with respect to `u` and `v` using `np.gradient`.
* The **magnitude of the cross product** of these tangent vectors gives the area of each infinitesimal surface patch.
* We then **sum all these small patch areas** over the entire surface using:

```python area = np.sum(cross) * du * dv ```

This approach is based on the formula:

$$
A \approx \sum \left\| \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial v} \right\| \, du \, dv
$$

This is a standard method in surface integral approximations.



### 3. **Challenges Faced**

* **Parametric complexity**: A Möbius strip is non-orientable, and its parameterization involves a half-twist. Ensuring this twist was accurately represented in the 3D mesh required careful use of trigonometric functions (especially `cos(u/2)` and `sin(u/2)`).
* **Surface area approximation**: Implementing numerical gradient and cross products needed precision with step sizes `du` and `dv`, or the computed area would be incorrect.
* **Edge length handling**: Since the Möbius strip has a single edge topologically, but we parameterize two boundaries (`v = ±w/2`), we sum both to represent the full physical edge (if it were a physical band with thickness).
* **Visualization**: Ensuring a smooth and visually accurate 3D plot required a high enough resolution (`n ≥ 200`) for clarity, especially for the twist.
